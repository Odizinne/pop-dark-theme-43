# Pop-dark theme 43+

[<img src="Images/screenshot-dark.png">](Images/vm_exemple.png)

## Why is this for?

This is a "port" of the Pop-os dark gnome-shell theme for gnome 43+ (quick settings).

I've been trying to keep the Pop-Os spirit and color scheme.

This is my first experience with CSS, and this theme was created for my personal use.

## How to install

Clone this repository and place the "Pop-dark-43" folder in your .themes directory.

## To do

- Light theme
- More polish here and there
- Fix bugs (you tell me)
- Logout dialog
- OSD rework
